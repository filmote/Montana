# Montana
Montana is the Arduboy version of the card game "Montana Solitaire" also known as "Gaps Solitaire"

Game explanation: 
The goal of this game is to place all the cards of a 52-card deck in 4 rows in order, starting with the 2 and ending with the king. 
At the beginning of the game, all cards are laid down and the aces are removed. This creates 4 gaps. A gap can be filled with a card of the same suit and 1 number higher than the card to the left of the gap. If there is a gap in the first column, it can only be filled with any 2. If there is a gap to the right of the king, no other cards can be placed here.

Use the arrow buttons to select a card. With the A-button the chosen card is automatically moved to the correct gap. If there are no more moves possible, press the B-button to reshuffle the cards which are not in the right place. 

Have fun.
